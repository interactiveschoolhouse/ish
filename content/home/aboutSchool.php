            Our active learning center offers individuals, families and groups a wide variety of educational resources and services. Since opening our doors in the spring of 2013, we have facilitated the tutoring and mentoring of hundreds of students and individuals from across the region. We also offer fun workshops for kids and adults.  Please take a few moments to explore our new website, or contact me personally with any questions you might have about me, our staff, or our wonderful facility here in Three Rivers, a village of Palmer, MA.
